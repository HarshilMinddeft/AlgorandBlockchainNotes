AVM and algo Notes 

There are 3 types of storage in algo
1) Local Storage => Account =>Can be read by anyone on chain
2) Box Storage => Contract  => Can be access by the app it belong to
3) Global Storage => Global =>Can be read by anyone on chain

-By adding deleteApplication function smartcontracts can be deleted from algochain

-In algo every contract creation and call is worth 0.001 
so more complex transection on algo are not much expensive

-python on Avm for development 
As a partial implementation of the Python programming language, it maintains the syntax and semantics of Python. The subset of the language that is supported will grow over time, but it will never be a complete implementation due to the restricted nature of the AVM as an execution environment. As a trivial example, the async and await keywords, and all associated features, do not make sense to implement.

-In algorand smartcontracts itself is not account,Here every smartcontract have a unique appID that is unique identifyer of smartcontract
-If we send tokens to smartcontract we are actully sending it to a linked application account.
Every algo smartcontract have an associated application account.
